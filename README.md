# 1-Linear-Regression

**Python Linear Regression Code Repository**

This repository contains Python code for linear regression, a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

The codes are organized into folders based on the topic covered, such as:

* **Introduction to Linear Regression**
* **Simple Linear Regression**
* **Multiple Linear Regression**
* **Linear Regression Model Evaluation**
* **Linear Regression Model Prediction**

Each folder contains code files with examples and exercises. The files are well-documented, with comments explaining what each line does.

This repository is useful for students, researchers, and professionals who want to learn or apply linear regression in Python.

**Keywords:**

* linear regression
* python
* statistics
* machine learning
* data science

**Code Examples:**

* Simple linear regression to predict the price of a car based on its mileage and year of manufacture.
* Multiple linear regression to predict a student's grade on an exam based on their class attendance, study hours, and performance on previous tests.
* Evaluation of a linear regression model using RÂ², mean squared error, and standard error of the estimate.
* Prediction of an unknown value using a linear regression model.

**How to Contribute:**

Contributions are welcome! You can submit pull requests to fix bugs, add new examples or exercises, or improve the documentation.

To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Make the necessary changes.
4. Submit a pull request to the master branch.

We appreciate your contribution!
